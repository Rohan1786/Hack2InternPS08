# Web App for AI-Powered Data Visualizations

## Project Overview
This web application allows users to create data visualizations using AI. Users can sign in with Google and access a user-friendly, two-step wizard to generate customized charts. In the first step, users input a prompt to create a visualization. In the second step, they can adjust chart settings such as titles, colors, and legends, and export the final output as code or an image.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign in with Google to access the main application.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI or a similar AI API for natural language processing and chart generation.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts using Chart.js, D3.js, or Highcharts.
- **Customization Options**: Customizable titles, colors, and legends for personalizing visualizations.
- **Export Options**: Export visualizations as code or downloadable images.

## Example Use Case
Create a pie chart illustrating voter distribution for the 2024 US elections:
- **Democratic Party**: 52%
- **Republican Party**: 48%

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js or SvelteKit
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, SCSS, or Plain CSS
- **Authentication**: Clerk, Auth0, or a similar service
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API, Gemini API, or a similar service
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js, D3.js, or Highcharts

## Project Structure
### Authentication Module
- Handles user sign-in and session management.

### Chart Wizard
- **Step 1**: Input prompt to generate a chart.
- **Step 2**: Customize visualization properties.

### Export Functionality
- Allows exporting the visualization as code or an image.

### UI Design
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS or custom styling.

## Deliverables
- **Live Demo**: Hosted on platforms like Vercel or Netlify for a seamless user experience.
- **GitHub Repository**: Clean, well-documented code with comments and a clear project structure.
- **Project Video**: A 2-minute walkthrough video explaining the project and its features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (latest LTS version)
- npm or yarn for package management

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohan1786/ai-data-visualization.git


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
