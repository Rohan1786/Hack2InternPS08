AI-Powered Data Visualization Web App
# Project Overview

This web application allows users to create data visualizations using the power of AI. Users can sign in with Google and access a user-friendly, two-step wizard to generate customized charts.

## Key Features

User Authentication: Sign in with Google for secure access.
AI Integration: Utilizes OpenAI or similar API for natural language processing and chart generation.
Data Visualization: Interactive charts using Chart.js, D3.js, or Highcharts.
Customization Options: Customize titles, colors, and legends for personalized visualizations.
Export Options: Export visualizations as code or downloadable images.
## Example Use Case

Prompt: "Create a pie chart illustrating voter distribution for the 2024 US elections."

The app generates a pie chart with slices for Democratic and Republican parties. Users can then customize:

Title: "2024 US Presidential Election Voter Preferences"
Colors
Legend
## Tech Stack

Frontend: React with Next.js or SvelteKit
Styling: Tailwind CSS, SCSS, or Plain CSS
Authentication: Clerk, Auth0, or similar service
AI Integration: OpenAI API, Gemini API, or similar service
Data Visualization: Chart.js, D3.js, or Highcharts
## Project Structure

Authentication Module: Handles user sign-in and session management.
Chart Wizard:
Step 1: Input prompt to generate a chart.
Step 2: Customize visualization properties.
Export Functionality: Allows exporting the visualization as code or an image.
UI Design: Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS or custom styling.
## Deliverables

Live Demo: Hosted on Vercel or Netlify.
GitHub Repository: Clean, well-documented code.
Project Video: 2-minute walkthrough video.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
